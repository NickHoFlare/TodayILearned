# Things I learned while developing this project
## .NET6
    - The introduction of nullable reference types
    - The introduction of expression-bodied class constructors, backed by a compact tuple-assignment syntax
    - The introduction of a class "Deconstructor" which allows for the properties of a class to be "destructured" much like in JS.
