# Development Setup
## Development Container
This project uses VS Code [Development Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
To get started, make sure you have Docker installed, and install the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) VS Code extension.

Once you have done the above, [pull down this repository from GitHub](https://github.com/terran324/refresh) and open it in VS Code.

Assuming you have installed the requisite VS Code extensions, you should see the notification toast pop up:
![Reopen folder in container](/readmeAssets/reopenInContainerToast.png "Reopen folder in container")

If you have missed the toast, you can also open the folder manually by hitting F1 and typing
> Open folder in container

You should be able to see the option highlighted in the VS Code Command menu:
![Open folder in container](/readmeAssets/openFolderInContainer.png "Open folder in container")

Selecting either of the above should spin up the container in Docker, and you should have the source code open for you in the Dev Container, within VS Code.
